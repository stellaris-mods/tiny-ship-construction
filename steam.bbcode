[h1][b]Tinyifies the ship construction list on spaceports! So much room for activities yay![/b][/h1]
Compatible with 1080/1440 addons, NSC, Realistic Ships, and all that jazz.

[b][i]I do not actually play Stellaris, I only make mods. That is how I have fun. Since I do not actually play, I have no idea what would be best for you. Please give me written feedback.[/i][/b]

Enjoy! \o/
